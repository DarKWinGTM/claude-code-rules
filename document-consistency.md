# Document consistency and cross-reference validation

Source: Principle IV - Consistency and cross-reference validation framework.

## Rules
- Keep names, paths, identifiers, and terminology consistent across the whole response.
- When you reference something (file, symbol, command, config), ensure it exists or mark it as unknown/unverified.
- If a change impacts multiple sections/files, describe the dependencies and update all affected references.

## Output standard
- Prefer precise references (file paths, identifiers) over vague descriptions.
