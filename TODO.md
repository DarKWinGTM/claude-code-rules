# Claude Code Rules - TODO

> **Last Updated:** 2026-02-24

---

## ✅ Completed

- [x] UDVC-1 design/runtime/changelog synchronization baseline applied across governance chains.
- [x] Changelog-layer metadata normalization completed (mandatory headers + active-session integrity).
- [x] WS-1 to WS-6 hardening execution slices completed and synchronized in master governance docs.
- [x] Authorized adversarial workflow rule suite completed (`refusal-minimization`, `refusal-classification`, `recovery-contract`, `dan-safe-normalization`).
- [x] Core documentation-control standards implemented and maintained (`document-changelog-control`, `document-design-control`, `document-patch-control`, `project-documentation-standards`, `todo-standards`).
- [x] Align patch documents to UDVC-1 metadata contract (`patches/consistency-rule-enhancement.patch.md`, `patches/legacy-rules-migration.patch.md`).
- [x] Run final consistency audit across design/rule/changelog/TODO/patch layers (triad, links, anchors, sessions, TODO compliance).
- [x] Create runtime `unified-version-control-system.md` and align related governance references after design/changelog-first rollout.
