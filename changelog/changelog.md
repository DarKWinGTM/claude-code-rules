## Version 2.2: Simplified TODO.md Format

**Date:** 2026-01-21
**Session:** a77b77ae-ef2a-49f6-93d9-f78c8ac2d2f7

### Changes
- **Removed phases (P0, P1, P2, P3)** - Simpler task list without priority levels
- **Removed priorities** - Keep tasks flexible, no artificial prioritization
- **Removed deadlines** - No artificial time pressure
- **Removed progress dashboard** - Reduce overhead, focus on actual work
- **Simplified to three sections**: Completed, Tasks To Do, History
- **Updated todo-standards.design.md to v2.0** - Reflects simplified approach
- **Preserved all historical data** - 48 completed tasks summarized, not deleted

### Rationale
Complex TODO systems often become stale and unmaintained. Simple lists are easier to keep current. Priorities shift over time, making fixed P0-P3 labels inaccurate. Deadlines are often arbitrary and missed. Keep TODO.md focused on actual work, not overhead.

### Key Changes
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 389 lines with detailed timestamps | 70 lines with simple format |
| P0-P3 priority levels | No priorities, flexible task list |
| Created/Started/Completed dates | Only "Last Updated" date |
| Progress dashboard metrics | Simple completed summary |
| Status badges ([IN PROGRESS], etc.) | Clean checkbox format |

### Preserved Data
All 48 completed tasks are preserved in summary format:
- 16 rules files implemented
- 16 design files created
- README.md modernized
- Changelog system established
- All visual assets generated

### Summary
TODO.md simplified to focus on actual work while preserving all historical data

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| TODO.md | Simplified format, preserved historical data |
| design/todo-standards.design.md | Updated to v2.0 with simplified standards |
| changelog/changelog.md | Updated to v2.2 |
