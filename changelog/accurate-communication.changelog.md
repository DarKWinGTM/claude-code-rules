## Version 1.1: Redesign as Flexible Principles

**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Session:** (current session)

### Changes
- Changed from rigid format rules to smart, flexible principles
- Introduced two core principles:
  1. Communication Clarity Principle: "ผู้รับสารต้องเข้าใจ context ครบถ้วนจากข้อความเดียว"
  2. Verification Honesty Principle: "อ้างสิ่งที่พิสูจน์ได้เท่านั้น"
- Added context-based flexibility guidelines
- Added decision framework for when to apply each principle
- Added anti-patterns to avoid

### Summary
Redesigned from rigid rules to smart, flexible principles that can be applied with judgment based on context.

### Rationale
User feedback: "ต้องการให้การสร้างกฏ นั้นเป้นกฏ ที่ smart ยืดหยุ่นใช้ได้จริง ไม่ใช่กฏ แบบถื้อ ๆ โง้่ ๆ"
