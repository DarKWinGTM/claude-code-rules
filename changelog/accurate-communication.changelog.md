### Changes
- Changed from rigid format rules to smart, flexible principles
- Introduced two core principles:

  2. Verification Honesty Principle: "Claim only what can be proven."
- Added context-based flexibility guidelines
- Added decision framework for when to apply each principle
- Added anti-patterns to avoid

### Summary
